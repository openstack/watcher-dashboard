    Add support for specifying start and end times when creating CONTINUOUS
    audits in the Watcher dashboard. The Create Audit form now shows
    ISO 8601 local time fields "Start time" and "End time" for CONTINUOUS
    audits and submits them to the Watcher API. Times are sent in ISO 8601
    format and are converted to UTC by the server.
