    The Create Audit Template form now filters the ``Strategy`` dropdown
    by the selected ``Goal``. Previously, all strategies were listed,
    which could lead to selecting an incompatible strategy. The UI now
    loads strategies dynamically after a goal is chosen, mirroring the
    CLI behavior of ``openstack optimize strategy list --goal <goal>``.
    When no goal is selected, the Strategy field remains empty with only
    the default "Select Strategy" option.
