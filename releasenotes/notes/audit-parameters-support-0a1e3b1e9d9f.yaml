    Watcher Dashboard now supports passing strategy parameters when creating
    audits, matching the OpenStack CLI ``openstack optimize audit create -p
    <name=value>``.

    A new "Strategy Parameters" field accepts all the parameters as a JSON object. 
    Server-side validation parses and validates the input, and the field remains
    backward compatible when left empty.

    The Create Audit dialog also shows available parameters for the selected
    strategy (when the Watcher API exposes ``parameters_spec``), including
    types, defaults, and descriptions from audit templates. This provides
    real-time guidance to users and improves parity with the CLI experience.

    The Audit Details view now displays the parameters that were used for the
    audit.
